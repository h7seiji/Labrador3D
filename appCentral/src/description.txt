IN PC
================================


(1) start SFM_Data
 - from a number of images, we start a sfmdata.bin file
 - start folder structure

(2) Take picture
 - from a initialized sfm-data structure, communicate boards to take picture
 - store pictures in MVE/views/viewXXXX
 - store feat/desc in imageDescribe/viewXXXX

(3) SFM
 - make sequential SFM from images, feat-desc files and sfm.bin
 - returns sparse cloud point, match.txt and export to MVE
 - sfm-data has camera poses and tracks

(4) Triangulation
 - make triangulation from computed camera poses (sfm-data.bin)
 - uses match.txt info to accelerate feature matching
 - returns sfm-data.bin (tracks and poses)

(5) clean MVE data and export to MVE

(5) continues to MVE procedures


================================
(when delete previous files?)

(1) CALIBRATION
(delete whole folders)
 a) start SFM
 b) take picture
 c) sequential-sfm

2) KNOWN-POSES
(keep MVE folder structure, but delete MVE/synth, meta, depth, and undist)
(da erro se nao tiver as pastas)
 a) take pictures
 b) triangulation
 c) MVE and MVS-Texture

3) FULL RECONSTRUCTION
(delete whole folders)
 a) start
 b) take picture
 c) sequential-sfm
 d) MVE and MVS-Texture
